- ðŸš§ ReplicaSets - Control replica sets (coming soon)
- ðŸš§ Pods - Direct pod management (coming soon)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- kubectl proxy running (for local development)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd packages/kubernetes-dashboard
npm install
```

2. Start kubectl proxy to access your Kubernetes API:
```bash
kubectl proxy
```

This will start a proxy server on `http://localhost:8001` that the dashboard will use to communicate with your cluster.

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Configuration

By default, the dashboard connects to `http://localhost:8001` (kubectl proxy). To connect to a different cluster or use authentication:

1. Update the `services/kubernetes-client.ts` file
2. Set your cluster endpoint and authentication token

## Development

### Project Structure

```
kubernetes-dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/              # Next.js app directory
â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/          # ShadCN UI components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resources/   # Kubernetes resource components
â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Business logic and API clients
â””â”€â”€ lib/            # Utility functions
```

### Adding New Resources

1. Create a new component in `components/resources/`
2. Add the resource to the navigation in `app/page.tsx`
3. Implement the resource-specific API calls in `services/kubernetes-client.ts`

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Security Considerations

- Never expose the dashboard publicly without proper authentication
- Use RBAC to limit dashboard permissions
- Consider using a service account with limited permissions
- Always use HTTPS in production
