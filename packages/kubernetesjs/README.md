KubernetesJS is a **fully-typed**, zero-dependency TypeScript library designed to simplify interactions with Kubernetes APIs. With comprehensive TypeScript support, it provides a strongly-typed interface that makes managing Kubernetes resources clear and predictable, ideal for TypeScript developers looking to integrate Kubernetes management into their applications.

## Features

- **üîí Fully Typed**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all functions and models for an enhanced development experience.
- **üöÄ Zero Dependencies**: Works out of the box without the need for additional installations.
- **üì° Full Kubernetes API Coverage**: Supports all Kubernetes API endpoints with detailed TypeScript types.
- **üåê Cross-Platform**: Works with both Node.js and browser environments.

## Installation

To install KubernetesJS, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install kubernetesjs
# or
yarn add kubernetesjs

```

## Example

```js
import { KubernetesClient } from "kubernetesjs";

const client = new KubernetesClient({
  restEndpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:8001'
});

const result = await client.listCoreV1NamespacedPod({
  path: { namespace: 'default' }
});

if (result.items && result.items.length) {
  result.items.forEach(item => {
    console.log('NODE:', item.spec.nodeName);

    const initContainers = item.status.initContainerStatuses?.map(ic => ({
      image: ic.image,
      name: ic.name,
      ready: ic.ready,
      state: ic.state
    }));

    const containers = item.status.containerStatuses?.map(c => ({
      image: c.image,
      name: c.name,
      ready: c.ready,
      state: c.state
    }));

    console.log({ containers });
    console.log({ initContainers });
  });
}
```
